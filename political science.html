    <h2>About the Programme</h2>
    <p>Political science is the study of important political issues of the day, as well as research into policy-making and major political trends and movements. The field requires a fair amount of statistical analysis, awareness of world events, and research into the history of political movements.

        A BA in Political Science varies in cost depending on what school you choose to attend. However, the program generally takes between three and five years to complete. Total costs should be estimated with this number in mind.
        
        Many individuals who go into politics, public policy, or lobbying work begin with a BA in Political Science. There are also jobs available in analysis or research for those who also want to get a solid background in statistics. There are jobs available in the public, private, and non-profit sector. However, it is important to note that many high-level positions require a postgraduate degree, to be completed after acquiring a bachelor’s degree.
        
        Many institutions around the world offer a bachelor’s in political science program with the opportunity for students to get their degree online. Online study means that location is not an issue in finding the program that is right for you.
