    <h2>About the Programme</h2>
    <p>It has been routine to speak of geography as an art as well as a science, but there is little evidence to demonstrate any really firm relationship with the central ground of the arts. Most of the recent emphasis on 'humanistic geography' remains closely associated with science and does not represent any substantial participation in the humanities. A review of recent writings on 'geography and literature' suggests that these two realms of work remain discrete, with geographers as borrowers from rather than creators of literature. However, there is some evidence, and a growing momentum toward geography as an art in the full sense of highly personal, explicitly emotional works which must be judged as individual creations. Something of the nature of such work with a few examples of its possibilities, including its difficulties and dangers, are discussed, and the work of Henry Glassie and Raymond Williams is cited as especially pertinent for geography. It is concluded that geography will deserve to be called an art only when it has overcome its chronic insecurity, broken through pedantic barriers, and can display a substantial number of geographers as creative artists.</p><br>
